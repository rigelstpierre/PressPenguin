## Lightweight WordPress Theme Framework
A simple, lightweight theme framework for creating WordPress themes faster. I've compiled the code I always use in developing WordPress themes as well as a few plugins that I almost always include.

### Markup

The markup is clean and uses html5.

### CSS

Stylesheets for layout are absent as this is meant as a framework to develop custom themes with. Only the most basic css declarations that always find their way into my themes are included, as well as blank stylesheets for ie, print, and a reset.

I've found that the comments section is usually left until later in the process, so I've also included a stylesheet for the comments area from the Twentyten theme just to get the comments going faster.

### functions.php

The functions.php file is stripped of a lot of fat, and includes a function for custom excerpt lengths with a custom 'Read More' link.

### Internet Explorer

I've included some jQuery for transparent png's in IE6, for rounded corners, and an .htc file box-shadow. There's more info in the ie.css file.
